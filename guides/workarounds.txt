1. NetworkManager with OpenConnect

When using NetworkManager with OpenConnect might generate this error:
SIOCSIFMTU: Op√©ration non permise

This is due to the MTU size of the VPN server being unusual. NetworkManager doesn't seem to have enough
permissions to fix the said issue. Try the following command and restart the computer after:

setcap cap_net_admin+ep /usr/bin/openconnect
